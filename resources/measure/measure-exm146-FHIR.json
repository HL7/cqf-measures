  "clinicalRecommendationStatement": "Institute for Clinical Systems Improvement (ICSI) (2007) <br> Reduce unnecessary use of antibiotics. Antibiotic treatment should be reserved for a bacterial illness. Diagnosis of group A beta streptococcal Pharyngitis should be made by laboratory testing rather than clinically. <br>Infectious Disease Society of America (Bisno et al. 2002) <br>The signs and symptoms of group A streptococcal and other (most frequently viral) pharyngitides overlap broadly. Therefore, unless the physician is able with confidence to exclude the diagnosis of streptococcal pharyngitis on epidemiological and clinical grounds alone, a laboratory test should be done to determine whether group A streptococci are present in the pharynx. <br>With the exception of very rare infections by certain other pharyngeal bacterial pathogens (eg, Corynebacterium diphtheriae and Neisseria gonorrhoeae), antimicrobial therapy is of no proven benefit as treatment for acute pharyngitis due to bacteria other than group A streptococci. Therefore, it is extremely important that physicians exclude the diagnosis of group A streptococcal pharyngitis to prevent inappropriate administration of antimicrobials to large numbers of patients with pharyngitis. <br>Michigan Quality Improvement Consortium (2007)<br>Probability of group A beta hemolytic streptococci (GABHS): Low; Testing: None; Treatment: Symptomatic treatment only. Avoid antibiotics. Probability of GABHS: Intermediate or High; Testing: Throat Culture (TC) OR Rapid Screen; Treatment: If TC is positive, use antibiotics. If TC is negative, use symptomatic treatment only. Avoid antibiotics. If treatment is started and culture result is negative, stop antibiotics. If Rapid Screen is positive, use antibiotics. If Rapid Screen is negative, culture (Culture is optional for age 16 and over) and only use antibiotics if throat culture is positive. (Michigan, 2007)",
