## Capability Statement

The above capabilities are formally captured in the following capability statement:

[CQFMMeasureTerminologyService](CapabilityStatement-measure-terminology-service.html)

TODO: Support paged operations for: Code lookup, validation, expansion
TODO: Consider how Measure value set and terminology usage is determined by the Terminology Service

## Examples

### Expansion of a value set that contains "legacy codes"

This is the computable representation of an example Chronic Liver Disease value set. It
contains two concepts that are active (as of the 2019-09 release of SNOMED-CT) and one
concept that was last active in the 2015-03 release).

* [ChronicLiverDiseaseLegacyExample](ValueSet-chronic-liver-disease-legacy-example.html)

The `compose` element of this value set is:

```
"compose": {
  "inactive": true,
  "include": [
    {
      "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
      "concept": [
        {
          "code": "1116000",
          "display": "Chronic aggressive type B viral hepatitis (disorder)"
        },
        {
          "code": "10295004",
          "display": "Chronic viral hepatitis (disorder)"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
      "version": "2015-03",
      "concept": [
        {
          "code": "111370006",
          "display": "Cirrhosis of liver not due to alcohol (disorder)"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Note specifically the use of the `inactive` element to indicate that the
value set definition contains inactive codes, and the use of separate
`include` elements, one for the codes that do not specify a code system version,
and one for the _legacy_ code from version `2015-03`.

#### Current expand

Given the following `$expand`:

```
[base]/ValueSet/chronic-liver-disease-legacy-example/$expand
```

The expected [result](ValueSet-chronic-liver-disease-legacy-example-current.html) expansion is:

```
"expansion": {
  "timestamp": "2021-02-05T08:57:00-06:00",
  "contains": [
    {
      "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
      "code": "1116000",
      "display": "Chronic aggressive type B viral hepatitis (disorder)"
    },
    {
      "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
      "code": "10295004",
      "display": "Chronic viral hepatitis (disorder)"
    },
    {
      "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
      "inactive": true,
      "code": "111370006",
      "display": "Cirrhosis of liver not due to alcohol (disorder)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note the use of the `inactive` element to indicate the code `111370006` is inactive in the
current version of SNOMED (i.e. the version of SNOMED that was active when this
expansion was produced, and the use of the `timestamp` to ensure that date is known).

#### Current expand, activeOnly

Given the following `$expand`:

```
[base]/ValueSet/chronic-liver-disease-legacy-example/$expand?activeOnly=true
```

The expected [result](ValueSet-chronic-liver-disease-legacy-example-current-active.html) expansion is:

```
"expansion": {
  "timestamp": "2021-02-05T08:57:00-06:00",
  "parameter": [
    {
      "name": "activeOnly",
      "valueBoolean": true
    }
  ],
  "contains": [
    {
      "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
      "code": "1116000",
      "display": "Chronic aggressive type B viral hepatitis (disorder)"
    },
    {
      "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
      "code": "10295004",
      "display": "Chronic viral hepatitis (disorder)"
    }
  ]
}
```

The result of the `activeOnly` parameter is to exclude the inactive code, even
though it was explicitly included in the value set definition.

#### Version-specific expand

Given the following `$expand`:

```
[base]/ValueSet/chronic-liver-disease-legacy-example/$expand?valueSetVersion=2020-05&system-version=http://snomed.info/sct|2019-09
```

The expected [result](ValueSet-chronic-liver-disease-legacy-example-2019-09.html) expansion is:

```
"expansion": {
  "timestamp": "2021-02-05T08:57:00-06:00",
  "parameter": [
    {
      "name": "valueSetVersion",
      "valueString": "2020-05"
    },
    {
      "name": "system-version",
      "valueUri": "http://snomed.info/sct|2019-09"
    }
  ],
  "contains": [
    {
      "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
      "code": "1116000",
      "display": "Chronic aggressive type B viral hepatitis (disorder)"
    },
    {
      "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
      "code": "10295004",
      "display": "Chronic viral hepatitis (disorder)"
    },
    {
      "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
      "inactive": true,
      "code": "111370006",
      "display": "Cirrhosis of liver not due to alcohol (disorder)"
    }
  ]
}
```

Note this expansion contains the same codes as the `current` example, but is explicitly
bound to the 2019-09 version of the SNOMED code system.

### Quality Program Release (i.e. Version Manifest, or Binding Parameters Specification)

The following example illustrates an unversioned quality program specification,
referencing a single version and providing no version dependency bindings:

* [QualityProgramExample](Library-quality-program-example.html)

Specifically, the `composed-of` element of the library resource is used to identify
the measures included in the quality program:

```
"relatedArtifact": [
  {
    "type": "composed-of",
    "resource": "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/Measure/measure-exm",
    "display": "Example Measure"
  }
]
```

For the version binding information, the following _release_ of the quality program
illustrates specifying the versions of codesystem, valueset, and library dependencies
used by the measure in the quality program:

* [QualityProgramExample202005](Library-quality-program-example-2020-05.html)

Specifically, the `composed-of` element of the library resource now includes the version
of the measure, and the `depends-on` elements are used to specify version bindings
for the SNOMED-CT code system, and the library and value set dependencies of the
measure:

```
"relatedArtifact": [
  {
    "type": "composed-of",
    "resource": "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/Measure/measure-exm|2.0.0",
    "display": "Example Measure"
  },
  {
    "type": "depends-on",
    "resource": "http://hl7.org/fhir/Library/FHIR-ModelInfo|4.0.1"
  },
  {
    "type": "depends-on",
    "resource": "http://hl7.org/fhir/Library/FHIRHelpers|4.0.1"
  },
  {
    "type": "depends-on",
    "resource": "http://snomed.info/sct|2019-09"
  },
  {
    "type": "depends-on",
    "resource": "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/ValueSet/chronic-liver-disease-legacy-example|2020-05"
  }
]
```

Given the use of this _version manifest_, then the _manifest_ parameter can be used
in the `$expand` operation to provide values for the relevant parameters:

```
[base]/ValueSet/chronic-liver-disease-legacy-example/$expand?manifest=http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/Library/quality-program-example-2020-05
```

This is effectively an alternative mechanism for expressing the same value set and code system version specific expansion above,
and results in the same expansion, with the additional `manifest` parameter:

```
"expansion": {
  "timestamp": "2021-02-05T08:57:00-06:00",
  "parameter": [
    {
      "name": "valueSetVersion",
      "valueString": "2020-05"
    },
    {
      "name": "system-version",
      "valueUri": "http://snomed.info/sct|2019-09"
    },
    {
      "name": "manifest",
      "valueUri": "http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/Library/quality-program-example-2020-05"
    }
  ],
  "contains": [
    {
      "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
      "code": "1116000",
      "display": "Chronic aggressive type B viral hepatitis (disorder)"
    },
    {
      "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
      "code": "10295004",
      "display": "Chronic viral hepatitis (disorder)"
    },
    {
      "system": "http://snomed.info/sct",
      "inactive": true,
      "code": "111370006",
      "display": "Cirrhosis of liver not due to alcohol (disorder)"
    }
  ]
}
```
