# Overview
This page describes documents the use cases and conformance expectations of a terminology service to support authoring, distribution, and evaluation of FHIR-based quality measure specifications as described in this implementation guide.

## Code Systems

1. SHALL Represent basic CodeSystem information, as specified by the [ShareableCodeSystem](http://hl7.org/fhir/shareablecodesystem.html) profile, which includes url, version, name, status, experimental, publisher, description, caseSensitive, content, and concept.

2. For published CodeSystems, SHALL represent publishable CodeSystem information, as specified by the [CQFMPublishableCodeSystem](StructureDefinition-publishable-codesystem-cqfm.html) profile.

3. SHALL support CodeSystem read by the server-defined id for the CodeSystem

4. SHALL support CodeSystem searches by:
    1. SHALL url: Returning all versions of the codesystem matching that url
    2. SHALL version: Returning the codesystem matching that version (can appear only in combination with a url search)
    3. SHALL identifier: Returning any codesystem matching the identifier
    4. SHALL name: Returning any codesystem matching the name, according to the string-matching semantics in FHIR
    5. SHALL title: Returning any codesystem matching the title, according to the string-matching semantics in FHIR
    6. SHOULD status: Returning codesystems that match the given status
    7. SHALL description: Returning any codesystem matching the search description, according to string-matching semantics in FHIR
    8. SHALL code: Returning any codesystem with the given code

5. SHALL support [CodeSystem/$lookup](http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-operation-lookup.html)

6. SHALL support [CodeSystem/$validate-code](http://hl7.org/fhir/codesystem-operation-validate-code.html)

7. TODO: Identify CodeSystems required for eCQM Development (CodeSystems referenced by ValueSets used in eCQM Development and/or referenced by bindings in QICore profiles)

## Value Sets

1. SHALL Represent basic ValueSet information, as specified by the [ShareableValueSet](http://hl7.org/fhir/shareablevalueset.html) profile, which includes url, version, name, status, experimental, publisher, and description.
    1. TODO: Need to support the ability to include specific codes that are inactive in their code systems, without requiring authors to maintain code system versions for all specific codes included from a code system.

2. SHALL Represent computable ValueSet information, as specified by the [CQFMComputableValueSet](StructureDefinition-computable-valueset-cqfm.html) profile, which specifies the definition of a value set using established extensions, or with the `compose` element, including in particular the ability to use the `inactive` element of the `include` to indicate that a specific code is inactive in the code system but should still be included in the expansion.

3. SHALL Represent executable ValueSet information, as specified by the [CQFMExecutableValueSet](StructureDefinition-executable-valueset-cqfm.html) profile, which specifies the complete content of a value set using the `expansion` element, including inactive codes specified in the compose.

4. For published ValueSets, SHALL represent publishable ValueSet information, as specified by the [CQFMPublishableValueSet](StructureDefinition-publishable-valueset-cqfm.html) profile.

5. SHALL support ValueSet read, by the server-defined id for the ValueSet

6. SHALL support ValueSet searches by:
    1. url: Returning all versions of the valueset matching that url
    2. version: Returning the valueset matching that version (can appear only in combination with a url search)
    3. identifier: Returning any valueset matching the identifier
    4. name: Returning any valueset matching the name, according to the string-matching semantics in FHIR
    5. title: Returning any valueset matching the title, according to the string-matching semantics in FHIR
    6. status: Returning valuesets that match the given status
    7. description: Returning any valueset matching the search description, according to string-matching semantics in FHIR
    8. code: Returning any valueset with the given code

7. SHALL Support [ValueSet/$validate-code](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-operation-validate-code.html)
    1. SHALL support the url parameter
    2. SHALL support the valueSetVersion parameter
    3. SHALL support the code parameter
    4. SHALL support the system parameter
    5. SHALL support the systemVersion parameter
    6. SHALL support the coding parameter
    7. SHALL support the codeableConcept parameter
    8. SHOULD support other parameters

8. Support [ValueSet/$expand](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-operation-expand.html)
    1. SHALL support the url parameter
    2. SHALL support the valueSetVersion parameter
    3. SHALL support the system-version parameter
    4. SHALL support the check-system-version parameter
    5. SHALL support the force-system-version parameter
    6. SHOULD support other parameters

9. TODO: Determine whether eCQM content development will ever need to be able to reference FHIR-defined value sets.

## Quality Programs (Binding Parameters Specification)

1. SHALL Represent basic quality program information, as specified by the [CQFMQualityProgram](StructureDefinition-quality-program-cqfm.html) profile, which includes identifier, title, type, date, useContext, effectivePeriod, measure, and terminology references

2. For published quality programs, SHALL represent publishable quality program information as specified by the [CQFMPublishableLibrary](StructureDefinition-publishable-library-cqfm.html) profile.

3. SHALL support Quality Program (Library) read, by the server-defined id for the quality program library

4. SHALL support Quality Program (Library) searches by:
    1. SHALL url: Returning all versions of the quality program matching that url
    2. SHALL version: Returning the quality program matching that version (can appear only in combination with a url search)
    3. SHALL identifier: Returning any quality program matching the identifier
    4. SHALL name: Returning any quality program matching the name, according to the string-matching semantics in FHIR
    5. SHALL title: Returning any quality program matching the title, according to the string-matching semantics in FHIR
    6. SHOULD status: Returning quality programs that match the given status
    7. SHALL description: Returning any quality programs matching the search description, according to string-matching semantics in FHIR
    8. SHALL composed-of: Returning any quality program that includes the given measure canonical
    9. SHALL depends-on: Returning any quality program that references the given code system or value set canonical

5. SHALL support quality program value set packaging: [Library/$package](OperationDefinition-Library-package.html) operation
    1. SHALL support the url parameter
    2. SHALL support the version parameter
