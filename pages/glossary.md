## A.1 Cohort

A measure score in which a population is identified from the population of all items being counted. For example, one can identify all the patients who have had H1N1 symptoms. This population is very similar to the Initial Population but is called a Cohort Population for the public health purposes.

## A.2 Continuous Variable

A measure score in which each individual value for the measure can fall anywhere along a continuous scale (e.g., mean time to thrombolytics which aggregates the time in minutes from a case presenting with chest pain to the time of administration of thrombolytics).

## A.3 Denominator

The lower part of a fraction used to calculate a rate, proportion, or ratio. The Denominator for proportion and ratio measures is a subset of the Initial Population, grouped for inclusion in a specific performance measure based on specific criteria (e.g., patient's age, diagnosis, prior MI). Different measures within a measure set may have different Denominators (e.g., measure #1 Denominator = Initial Population AND Smoker; measure #2 Denominator = Initial Population AND Atrial Fibrillation). A Denominator can have inclusion and exclusion criteria. Continuous Variable measures do not have a Denominator, but instead define a Measure Population.

## A.4 Denominator Exception

Those conditions that should remove a patient, procedure, or unit of measurement from the Denominator only if the Numerator criteria are not met. Denominator exceptions allow for adjustment of the calculated score for those providers with higher risk populations. Denominator exceptions are used only in proportion eMeasures. They are not appropriate for ratio or continuous variable eMeasures.

Denominator exceptions allow for the exercise of clinical judgment and should be specifically defined where capturing the information in a structured manner fits the clinical workflow. Generic denominator exception reasons used in proportion eMeasures fall into three general categories:

* Medical reasons
* Patient reasons
* System reasons

## A.5 Denominator Exclusion

Those patients who should be removed from the Initial population and denominator before determining if numerator criteria are met. Denominator exclusions are used in proportion and ratio measures to help narrow the denominator.

## A.6 eMeasure

A health quality measure expressed in HQMF format.

## A.7 Health Quality Measures Format (HQMF)

A standards-based formalism for the representation of quality measures. A quality measure expressed in HQMF format is also referred to as an "eMeasure".

## A.8 Initial Population

Identifies the eligible group of entities that the measure is designed to address. Details could include such information as specific age groups, diagnoses, diagnostic and procedure codes, enrollment periods, insurance and health plan groups, etc. For example, a patient aged 18 years and older with a diagnosis of CAD who has at least two visits during the Measurement Period. The Initial Population may be the same across all quality measures within a single quality measure set, but this is not required. All patients counted (e.g., as Numerator, as Denominator) are drawn from the Initial Population. The Initial Population can have inclusion and exclusion criteria.

## A.9 Measure Population

Continuous variable measures do not have a Denominator, but instead define a Measure Population. To be in the Measure Population, a patient must be in the larger Initial Population. Proportion and Ratio measures do not have a Measure Population, but instead define a Denominator.

## A.10 Measure Population Exclusion

Measure Population Exclusions are used in Continuous Variable eMeasures to define instances that should not be included in the Measure Population.

## A.11 Numerator

The upper portion of a fraction used to calculate a rate, proportion, or ratio. For a Proportion Measure, the Numerator is a subset of the Denominator, which defines the group of patients in the denominator for whom a process or outcome of care occurs (e.g., flu vaccine received).

## A.12 Numerator Exclusion

Numerator Exclusions are used in Proportion and Ratio eMeasures to define instances that should not be included in the Numerator (e.g., infections with a specific bacterium for a measure considering the number of central line blood stream infections per 1000 catheter days).

## A.13 Outcome Measure

A measure that indicates the result of the performance (or non-performance) of a function or process.

## A.14 Process Measure

A measure which focuses on a process which leads to a certain outcome, meaning that a scientific basis exists for believing that the process, when executed well, will increase the probability of achieving a desired outcome.

## A.15 Proportion

A score derived by dividing the number of cases that meet a criterion for quality (the numerator) by the number of eligible cases within a given time frame (the denominator) where the numerator cases are a subset of the denominator cases (e.g., percentage of eligible women with a mammogram performed in the last year).

## A.16 Quality Measure Set

A unique grouping of measures carefully selected to provide, when viewed together, a robust picture of the care provided in a given domain (e.g., cardiovascular care, pregnancy).

## A.17 Quality Measures

A quantitative tool that provides an indication of an individual or organization's performance in relation to a specified process or outcome via the measurement of an action, process, or outcome of clinical care. Quality measures are often derived from clinical guidelines and are designed to determine whether the appropriate care has been provided given a set of clinical criteria and an evidence base. Quality measures are also often referred to as performance measures or quality indicators.

## A.18 Rate Aggregation

The measure rate for an organization or clinician is based upon the entities' aggregate data and summarizes the performance of the entity over a given time period (e.g., monthly, quarterly, yearly). The aggregated data are derived from the results of a specific measure algorithm and, if appropriate, the application of specific risk adjustment models.

## A.19 Ratio

A score that may have a value of zero or greater that is derived by dividing a count of one type of data by a count of another type of data (e.g., the number of patients with central lines who develop infection divided by the number of central line days).

## A.20 Stratification

Criteria used to classify populations into one or more characteristics, variables, or other categories. As subsets of the overall population, they are used in risk adjustment, analysis and interpretation. Examples of stratification include age, discharge status for an inpatient stay, facility location within a hospital (e.g., ICU, Emergency Department), surgical procedures, and specific conditions.

## A.21 Supplemental Data Elements

Additional variables required for risk adjustment or other purposes of data aggregation. Comparison of results across strata can be used to show where disparities exist or where there is a need to expose differences in results. Examples of supplemental data elements include payer, ethnicity, race and gender.
