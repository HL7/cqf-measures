<h3>Quality Measurement Standards Landscape</h3>

<p>This implementation guide is part of a larger FHIR-based quality improvement and quality measurement standards landscape, depicted in the following diagram:</p>

<img src="assets/images/quality-measurement-standards-landscape.png" alt="Quality Measurement Standards Landscape"/>

<p>The left side of the quality measurement standards landscape diagram depicts the activities and standards associated with measure specification, while the right side depicts measure reporting.</p>
  
<p><b>Measure specification</b> involves the development, testing, validation, distribution, and data representation and capture of quality measures.</p>

<p><b>Measure reporting</b> involves the data collection and aggregation, calculation and analytics, and ultimately reporting of quality measures.</p>

<p><b>Producers</b> in the diagram represent the various stakeholders involved in the creation of healthcare data. Producers can include providers and provider systems; patients, care teams, caregivers, and patient engagement systems; and other related clinical systems such as laboratory, clinic, and hospital information systems that are primary producers of patient healthcare information.</p>

<p><b>Consumers</b> in the diagram represent the various stakeholders involved in the consumption and use of healthcare data. Consumers can include data routers and aggregators, payers, health information exchanges and health integrated networks, as well as public health and other healthcare-related agencies.</p>

<p><b>Specifiers</b> in the diagram represents the various stakeholders involved in the specification of quality measures for use in healthcare quality measurement and reporting. Specifiers can include quality agencies, public health, and other healthcare-related agencies, industry consortiums concerned with improving care quality, and clinical specialty societies. Specifiers may also be institutions and clinics using the quality measurement standards to specify quality measures for use in their own environments and quality improvement initiatives.</p>

<p>The shaded areas underlying the stakeholders depict the various standards involved:</p>

<h4>Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR)</h4>

<p>Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources, or FHIR, is an HL7 platform specification for healthcare that supports exchange of healthcare information between systems. FHIR is universally applicable, meaning that it can be used in a broad variety of implementation environments. The platform provides layers of implementation that support foundational protocols; base implementation functionality such as conformance and terminology; administrative functionality to represent patients, care teams, locations, and organizations; healthcare processes including clinical and diagnostic information, as well as medication, workflow, and financial; and finally, a clinical reasoning layer that provides support for the representation of knowledge and reasoning about healthcare.</p>

<p>The quality measurement standards landscape makes use of all these layers of FHIR: the foundational and implementation layers to define interactions and profiles; the administrative and process layers to represent the data of interest for quality measurement; and the clinical reasoning layer to specify and support evaluation and reporting of quality measures.</p>

<h4>Clinical Quality Language (CQL)</h4>

<p>Clinical Quality Language, or CQL, is an HL7 cross-paradigm specification that defines a high-level, domain-specific language focused on clinical quality and trageted at measure and decision support artifact authors. In addition, the specification describes a machine-readable canonical representation called Expression Logical Model (ELM) targeted at implementations and designed to facilitate sharing and evaluation of clinical knowledge.</p>

<p>This ability to render clinical knowledge in a high-level human-readable form as well as an intermediate-level, platform-independent machine-readable form makes CQL an ideal mechanism for specifying the criteria involved in quality measures.</p>

<h4>FHIR Quality Measure Implementation Guide</h4>

<p>The FHIR Quality Measure Implementation Guide defines conformance profiles and guidance focused on the specification of quality measures using the FHIR Measure and Library resources. The IG does not standardize the content of any particular measure, rather it defines the standard approach to the representation of that content so that quality measure specifiers can define and share standardized FHIR-based electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs).<p>
  
<h4>Quality Improvement Core Implementation Guide (QI Core IG)</h4>

<p>The Quality Improvement Core Implementation Guide, or QI-Core IG, defines a set of FHIR profiles with extensions and bindings needed to create interoperable, quality-focused applications. Importantly, the scope of QI Core includes both quality measurement and decision support to ensure that knowledge expressed can be shared across both domains. QI Core is derived from US Core, meaning that where possible, QI Core profiles are based on US Core to ensure alignment with and support for quality improvement data within healthcare systems in the US Realm.</p>

<h4>Data Exchange for Quality Measures (DEQM)</h4>

<p>The Data Exchange for Quality Measures Implementation Guide, or DEQM, defines conformance profiles and guidance focused on the exchange of the data of interest for quality measures, as well as quality measure reporting. The DEQM expects to use quality measures specified in accordance with the Quality Measure IG and QI Core.</p>

<h3>Data Model Standards Landscape</h3>

<p>The quality improvement ecosystem covers practically every aspect of the healthcare delivery system, and has the need to represent information involved across that spectrum. FHIR provides a foundation for the representation of all this information, but in a universally applicable way. As such, more specifity is needed to capture the intended meaning of healthcare information in particular use cases. As FHIR is more and more broadly adopted, consensus among participating stakeholders on the use of particular profiles and patterns enables semantic interoperability in more and more use cases.</p>

<p>Within the US Realm, the US Core profiles capture this base consensus, and although they enable a broad variety of interoperability use cases, they do not cover many of the data requirements for quality improvement use cases. The QI Core profiles derive from US Core and provide for this additional functionality.</p>

<p>In addition, there are some cases where additional specifity or functionality is required that is specific to quality measurement, or to a particular use case within quality measurement. In these cases, additional profiles may be defined within the DEQM, or by quality improvement programs and initiatives or other stakeholders such as measure developers. For example, the Medication Reconciliation Post Discharge measure example included in this implementation guide references the HEDIS Implementation Guide, which defines profiles for use with HEDIS measures.</p>

<p>The following diagram depicts this data model standards landscape:</p>

<img src="assets/images/data-model-standards-landscape.png" alt="Data Model Standards Landscape"/>

<p>As illustrated, FHIR provides the foundation, and sets of profiles are then built on top of FHIR that provide more and more focused use cases by constraining profiles and extending functionality to cover gaps. As these use cases and functionality are added to the top layers, they provide implementation experience that refines the definitions and guidance. Where applicable, profiles and extensions can be suggested back to the layers below, utilizing the consensus-based standards development process to achieve semantic interoperability more and more broadly.</p>

<p>This layering of profiles is a balancing act between the relative adoption and implementation maturity of FHIR and the data representation requirements of the use cases involved, and is guided by the following principles:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Avoid proliferation of profiles.</b> To the extent possible, make use of existing profiles further down the stack. Only define a new profile if absolutely necessary to express the requirements for a particular use case.</li>
  <li><b>Share profiles across measures.</b> There should _not_ be profiles specific to a particular measure. The resulting combinatorial explosion of profiles would be unsupportable. Instead, QI Core provides a layer for the expression of quality improvement requirements across measures and decision support artifacts.</li>
  <li><b>No terminology-narrowing-only profiles.</b> Profiles should _not_ be used to specify only terminology narrowing constraints. The FHIR Clinical Reasoning module and CQL enable the representation of data requirements for quality measures and decision support artifacts.</li>
  <li><b>Promote data-related profiles.</b> When it becomes necessary to define a data-related profile at the measurement-specific level (in DEQM or HEDIS for example), steps should be taken to promote that profile to the broadest consensus group possible.</li>
</ol>

<h4>FHIR Versioning Support</h4>

<p>There are three broadly used and fully published versions of the FHIR specification:</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>FHIR DSTU2</b> - This version has broad support among US-based vendors due to being the basis for the Argonaut profiles. Most major vendors today support some subset of this version of FHIR.</li>
  <li><b>FHIR STU3</b> - This is the version that US Core, QI Core, and many other implementation guides are based on. There is fairly broad vendor support for this version as well.</li>
  <li><b>FHIR R4</b> - This is the first normative release of FHIR, including several of the foundational, conformance, and administrative resources going normative.</li>
</ul>

<p>The implementation guides in this landscape are currently focused on FHIR STU3, with the plan to produce R4 versions once the US Core and QI Core profiles have been updated to R4.</p>

<h3>Quality Reporting Scenarios</h3>

<p>This implementation guide describes two groups of quality reporting scenarios. Exchange scenarios, focused on exchanging subsets of the data-of-interest for a particular measure or set of measures throughout the reporting period, and Reporting scenarios, focused on communicating the results of a quality measure at the end of a reporting period as part of a quality improvement initiative.</p>

<img src="assets/images/quality-reporting-scenarios.png" alt="Quality Reporting Scenarios"/>

<h4>Exchange Scenarios</h4>

<p>Exchange scenarios are used to exchange subsets of the data-of-interest for a measure or set of measures throughout the measurement period. These scenarios enable providers and quality stakeholders such as payers, accountable care organizations, and other secondary use partners to keep better track of how patients are performing with respect to a particular quality measure during the measurement cycle.</p>

<p>The three exchange scenarios are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Submit Data</b> - Used by a producing system to submit a subset of the data-of-interest for a measure to a consuming system</li>
  <li><b>Collect Data</b> - Used by a consuming system to collect a subset of the data-of-interest for a measure from a producing system</li>
  <li><b>Subscription</b> - Used to allow the producing system to notify the consuming system when new or updated data-of-interest for a measure is available</li>
</ol>

<h4>Reporting Scenarios</h4>

<p>Reporting scenarios are used to report the results of quality measures on patients or populations at the end of a reporting period. Measure reports are provided to attest the standard of care given to patients in a population as measured by specific quality measures. The measures are typically identified as part of a quality improvement program or initiative by a payer or other quality improvement stakeholder.</p>

<p>The three reporting scenarios are:</p>

<ol>
  <li><b>Individual</b> - Used to report the results of a quality measure for a particular patient along with the complete set of data-of-interest to a quality reporting receiver</li>
  <li><b>Summary</b> - Used to report the results of a quality measure for the applicable population to a quality reporting receiver</li>
  <li><b>Patient List</b> - Used to report the results of a quality measure for the applicable population, including the complete set of data-of-interest, to a quality reporting receiver</li>
</ol>
