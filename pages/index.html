<h3>1.1 Summary</h3>

<p>The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) Quality Measure Implementation Guide (this IG) describes an approach to representing electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs) using the FHIR Clinical Reasoning Module and Clinical Quality Language (CQL) in the US Realm. However, this Implementation Guide can be usable for multiple use cases across domains, and much of the content is likely to be usable outside the US Realm.</p>

<p>The implementation guide is based upon the previous generation of eCQM representation standards, the HL7 V3-based Health Quality Measure Format (HQMF) and accompanying implementation guides. As an HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide, changes to this specification are managed by the sponsoring Clinical Quality Information Work Group and are incorporated as part of the standard balloting process.</p>

<h4>1.1.1 Examples</h4>

<p>Refer to the <a href="http://build.fhir.org/ig/cqframework/qi-core">QI-Core implementation guide</a> for examples of how to represent data involved in calculation of quality measures.</p>
