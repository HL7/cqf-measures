## Quality Measure Implementation Guide
{: #quality-measure-implementation-guide}

### Summary
{: #summary}

The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) Quality Measure Implementation Guide (QM IG), describes an approach to representing Quality Measures (QMs) using the FHIR Clinical Reasoning Module and Clinical Quality Language (CQL) in the US Realm. However, this Implementation Guide can be usable for multiple use cases across domains, and much of the content is likely to be relevant outside the US Realm.

This IG is built upon on [FHIR Version R4](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/index.html) and accounts for content in previous generations of QM standards, the HL7 V3-based Health Quality Measure Format (HQMF) and accompanying implementation guides using FHIR. As an HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide, changes to this specification are managed by the sponsoring Clinical Quality Information Work Group and are incorporated as part of the standard balloting process.

#### Examples
{: #examples}

Refer to the [QI-Core implementation guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore) for examples of how to represent data involved in calculation of quality measures.

### How to read this Guide

-  **[Introduction](introduction.html)**: The introduction provides a more detailed overview of quality measurement and the background for this guide.
-  **[QMs](measure-conformance.html)**: This page describes measure representation and conformance requirements for QMs.
-  **[Using CQL](using-cql.html)**: This page covers using Clinical Quality Language to author QMs.
-  **[Composites](composite-measures.html)**: This page covers composite measure representation and conformance requirements.
-  **[Packaging](packaging.html)**: This page describes measure packaging and distribution requirements for QMs.
- **FHIR Artifacts**
  - **[Profiles](profiles.html)**: This page lists the set of profiles defined for use by QMs.
  - **[Extensions](extensions.html)**: This page lists the set of extensions defined for use by QMs.
  - **[Terminology](terminology.html)**: This page lists value sets and code systems defined in this IG.
  - **[Capabilities](capabilities.html)**: This page defines the workflows and roles for QMs and contains the capability statements.
  - **[Operations](operations.html)**: This page defines services and operations in support of authoring, publishing, and distributing QMs.

### Dependencies
The dependency on QI-Core is included for the purposes of example validation only.  In addition, the dependency on VSAC packages is indirect via the QI Core and US Core.  The conformance profiles in this IG do not make use of the value sets in VSAC.
