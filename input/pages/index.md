#### Note To Balloters

1. <span class="bg-success">We are seeking examples of non-patient subject composite measures for inclusion as examples in this implementation guide.</span>

2. <span class="bg-success">We are requesting additional guidance on MeasureImprovementNotation:</span>

   <span class="bg-success">Reviewers: CQI will be adding the code:</span>

   <span class="bg-success">`Reference range` with definition of score within a defined interval (or a “passing score” over or under a certain threshold) indicates better quality to the improvement notation value set. Please provide comments on this additional code and if there are other codes needed in this value set.</span>

   <span class="bg-success">If an additional code is added to the improvement notation (like normative reference range as suggested), where is guidance about the reference range best included in the specification for implementer use?  Some suggestions include: the guidance field, the rate aggregation field or adding an extension to improvementNotation to add text.</span>

## Quality Measure Implementation Guide
{: #quality-measure-implementation-guide}

### Summary
{: #summary}

The Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource (FHIR) Quality Measure Implementation Guide (this IG) describes an approach to representing Quality Measures (QMs) using the FHIR Clinical Reasoning Module and Clinical Quality Language (CQL) in the US Realm. However, this Implementation Guide can be usable for multiple use cases across domains, and much of the content is likely to be usable outside the US Realm.

The implementation guide is based upon the previous generation of QM representation standards, the HL7 V3-based Health Quality Measure Format (HQMF) and accompanying implementation guides. As an HL7 FHIR Implementation Guide, changes to this specification are managed by the sponsoring Clinical Quality Information Work Group and are incorporated as part of the standard balloting process.

#### Examples
{: #examples}

Refer to the [QI-Core implementation guide](http://hl7.org/fhir/us/qicore) for examples of how to represent data involved in calculation of quality measures.

### Dependencies
The dependency on QI-Core is included for the purposes of example validation only.  In addition the dependency on VSAC packages is indirect via the QI Core and US Core.  The conformance profiles in this IG do not make use of the value sets in VSAC.
