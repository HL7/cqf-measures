### Full Implementation Guide
{: #full-ig}

The following file contains the complete, downloadable implementation guide:

-  [Full IG](full-ig.zip)

### Definitions
{: #definitions}

In addition to the above, we have provided format-specific _definitions_:

-  [XML](definitions.xml.zip)
-  [JSON](definitions.json.zip)
-  [TTL](definitions.ttl.zip)

These files should be the first choice whenever generating any implementation artifacts since they contain all of the
rules about what makes these US Core profiles valid. Implementers will still need to be familiar with the content of the
specification and profiles that apply in order to make a conformant implementation. See the overview on
[validating FHIR profiles and resources](http://hl7.org/fhir/validation.html) for more information about validating
profiles and how to use these artifacts.

### Examples
{: #examples}

All examples used in this Implementation Guide:

-  [XML](examples.xml.zip)
-  [JSON](examples.json.zip)
