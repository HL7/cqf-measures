For systems that support authoring, different approaches may be used to indicate version of an artifact in draft status. 

For example, when created a draft version of a Library that is currently version 1.0.0, an authoring system may produce a 2.0.0-DRAFT version to allow for multiple drafts of the same artifact to be considered at once

When invoking the $data-requirements operation for a Measure, periodStart and periodEnd are provided in the parameters parameter.
