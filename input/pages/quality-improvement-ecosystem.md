#### Quality Improvement Ecosystem
{: #quality-improvement-ecosystem}

As shown in step 1 in the diagram below, the Quality Improvement Ecosystem
begins with information, preferably evidence-based from research, public health
surveillance, and data mining and other analyses performed by third parties such
as academic institutions or payers. Such information indicates existing status and knowledge about a
given clinical topic. In step 2, stakeholders, such as professional societies,
public health agencies, and governmental bodies, publish such information to assure awareness among consumers,
healthcare practitioners, and healthcare organizations about what is known and
suggested methods for managing the clinical topic. Ideally, suggested management
efforts are captured and documented in guidelines based on collaboration among
clinical subject matter experts, terminologists, informaticists, clinicians and
consumers.  In step 3, these clinical guidelines are translated into clinical
decision support (CDS) artifacts to incorporate relevant, evidence based, and patient-specific clinical
recommendations and actions directly within clinical workflow. To adequately
impact clinical care for clinicians and patients requires local implementation
activities as shown in Step 4.  CDS is not intended to replace clinician judgment, but rather to provide information to assist care team members in managing the complex and expanding volume of biomedical and person-specific data needed to make timely, informed, and higher quality decisions based on current clinical science. Ideally, the clinical guidelines and CDS include methods for evaluating what successful implementation means, (i.e., whether the clinical care ultimately provided included processes that addressed the intent of the guideline and if it achieved the desired outcomes). Further information on CDS and its optimization of care delivery can be found [here](https://www.healthit.gov/sites/default/files/page/2018-04/Optimizing_Strategies_508.pdf).
In step 5, to close the loop and enable continuous improvement, the results of such measurement
analytics must be reported for aggregate review. Step 6, "Reporting" serves the
purpose of evaluating clinical performance and outcomes, whether it be internally
for health care organizations, or for third parties such as public health or for payers.
Ultimately, this information may then serve as part of the evidence base shown in step 1.

> Practictioner organizations along with stakeholders such as public health
have ongoing needs for quality improvement at the point of care. Every effort should be made to
establish a capable distributed rule processing environment in FHIR. For
additional information about idealized processes for moving evidence and
information from guidelines to CDS and measurement, refer to an effort by the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) called
[Adapting Clinical Guidelines for the Digital Age](https://www.cdc.gov/ddphss/clinical-guidelines/index.html).
