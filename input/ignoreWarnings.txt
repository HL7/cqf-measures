# I've committed an updated JIRA-Spec-Artifacts, but this warnings persists, the spec file it generates appears to be incorrect (puts duplicate keys in, doesn't generate correct keys, and it's not clear where the incorrect information is coming from)
WARNING: The jira specification file appears to be out of date with the versions, artifacts and pages currently defined in the IG.  A proposed revised file to be reviewed and, if appropriate, submitted as a pull request against the XML folder in https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts.  To see the differences, perform a file compare on 'template/jira-current.xml' (a normalized view of what is in Github) and 'template/jira-new.xml' (reflects current IG content)


# This device profile is intended to model software systems as devices, not implantable devices like what the US Core profile is describing. Approved by US Realm on 6/30/2020.
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/device-softwaresystem-cqfm').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Device derive from the core US profile

# These warnings are all caused by the use of the new text/cql-identifier media type. This has been addressed in the current R5 build and are expected to resolve once the core package updates. Note that this issue is persisting for the supplemental data and stratifier criteria elements only, it isn't happening anymore for the population criteria expressions
