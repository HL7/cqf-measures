# CPT Code System cannot be validated, the content containing these codes is from measure developers, built with VSAC-enabled tooling, we are confident the CPT codes referenced here are correct
The definition for the Code System with URI 'http://www.ama-assn.org/go/cpt' doesnt provide any codes so the code cannot be validated
