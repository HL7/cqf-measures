# I have reviewed the proposed jira specification file and it is less correct than the one that is currently committed
WARNING: The jira specification file appears to be out of date with the versions, artifacts and pages currently defined in the IG.  A proposed revised file to be reviewed and, if appropriate, submitted as a pull request against the XML folder in https://github.com/HL7/JIRA-Spec-Artifacts.  To see the differences, perform a file compare on 'template/jira-current.xml' (a normalized view of what is in Github) and 'template/jira-new.xml' (reflects current IG content)

# This device profile is intended to model software systems as devices, not implantable devices like what the US Core profile is describing. Approved by US Realm on 6/30/2020.
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/device-softwaresystem-cqfm').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Device derive from the core US profile

# These warnings are all caused by the use of the new text/cql.identifier media type. This has been addressed in the current R5 build and are expected to resolve once the core package updates.
