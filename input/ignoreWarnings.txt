# The build still produces this warning, but the spec file it suggests is wrong because it does not include an artifact key that needs to be present and marked deprecated

# This device profile is intended to model software systems as devices, not implantable devices like what the US Core profile is describing. Approved by US Realm on 6/30/2020.
WARNING: StructureDefinition.where(url = 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures/StructureDefinition/device-softwaresystem-cqfm').baseDefinition: US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Device derive from the core US profile

# These warnings are all caused by the use of the new text/cql-identifier media type. This has been addressed in the current R5 build and are expected to resolve once the core package updates. Note that this issue is persisting for the supplemental data and stratifier criteria elements only, it isn't happening anymore for the population criteria expressions
