title: Quality Measure Implementation Guide
canonical: 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures'
introduction: >-
  This implementation guide describes an approach to representing electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs) using the FHIR Clinical Reasoning Module and Clinical Quality Language (CQL) in the U.S. Realm.
  However, this Implementation Guide can be usable for multiple use cases across domains, and much of the content is likely to be usable outside the U.S. Realm.

      Note to balloters:

      In addition to general feedback and ballot review, the sponsoring work group is specifically seeking feedback on the following areas of the specification:

      Whether the IG should elaborate on an alternative approach to measure scoring where the CQL retrieves MeasureReport resources and the CQL logic computes a score from the list of MeasureReport.group.measureScore(s). Assumes that populationBasis is a MeasureReport.
      
      The following resolutions have been voted on by the members of the sponsoring work group [HL7 International Clinical Quality Information](http://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/cqi/index.cfm).

      **Additional Guidance: improvementNotation**

      Reviewers: CQI will be adding the code:

      Reference range with definition of score within a defined interval (or a “passing score” over or under a certain threshold) indicates better quality to this value set.  Please provide comments on this additional code and if there are other codes needed in the improvement notation value set.

      If an additional code is added to the improvement notation (like normative reference range as suggested), where is guidance about the reference range best included in the specification for implementer use?  Some suggestions include: the guidance field, the rate aggregation field or adding an extension to improvementNotation to add text.
