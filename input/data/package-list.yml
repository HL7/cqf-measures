title: Quality Measure Implementation Guide
canonical: 'http://hl7.org/fhir/us/cqfmeasures'
introduction: >-
  This implementation guide describes an approach to representing electronic Clinical Quality Measures (eCQMs) using the FHIR Clinical Reasoning Module and Clinical Quality Language (CQL) in the U.S. Realm.
  However, this Implementation Guide can be usable for multiple use cases across domains, and much of the content is likely to be usable outside the U.S. Realm.

      The following resolutions have been voted on by the members of the sponsoring work group [HL7 International Clinical Quality Information](http://www.hl7.org/Special/committees/cqi/index.cfm).

      Note to balloters:

      In addition to general feedback and ballot review, the sponsoring work group is specifically seeking feedback on the following areas of the specification:
      1. [Data Element Submission Sequence](capabilities.html)
      1. [Measure Repository Service](measure-repository-service.html)
      1. [Measure Terminology Service](measure-terminology-service.html)
      1. [Composite Measure Modeling](composite-measures.html)
      1. Feedback on whether the conceptual notion of "intended data source" (as currently specified in narrative categories of "eCQM", "Administrative", and "Hybrid") can be usefully represented as part of FHIR measure
      1. Feedback on "identifier types" as defined in slices of the `identifier` element of the [Publishable Measure](StructureDefinition-publishable-measure-cqfm.html) profile
      1. The use of [Library Resources](using-cql.html#library-resources) and conformance requirements for FHIR and CQL
