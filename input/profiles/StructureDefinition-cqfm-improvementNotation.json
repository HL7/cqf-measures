Please provide comments on this additional code and if there are other codes needed in this value set.\n\nPlease provide comments on this additional code and if there are other codes needed in the improvement notation value set.\n\nIf an additional code is added to the improvement notation (like normative reference range as suggested), where is guidance about the reference range best included in the specification for implementer use?  Some suggestions include: the guidance field, the rate aggregation field or adding an extension to improvementNotation to add text.",
