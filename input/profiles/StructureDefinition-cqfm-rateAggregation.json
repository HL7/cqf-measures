The aggregated data are derived from the results of a specific measure algorithm and, if appropriate, the application of specific risk adjustment models.  Can also be used to describe how to risk adjust the data based on supplemental data elements described in the eMeasure (e.g., pneumonia hospital measures antibiotic selection in the ICU versus non-ICU and then the roll-up of the two). This could be applied to aggregated cohort measure definitions (e.g., CDC's aggregate reporting for TB at the state level).",
