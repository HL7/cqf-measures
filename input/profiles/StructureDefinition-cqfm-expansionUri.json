This can be specified at the quality program level, where it indicates the expansion identifier to be used for all expansions of value sets within the program (i.e. all the ValueSets would have expansions with the same identifier), or it can be specified on a specific ValueSet dependency, where it indicates the expansion identifier to be used for that value set.",
