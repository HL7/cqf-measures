title Data Element Submission Scenario
participant "Data Repository" as DR
participant "Data Extraction Service" as Extractor
participant "Knowledge Repository" as KR
participant "Terminology Service" as TS
participant "Measure Evaluation Service" as Evaluator
participant "Receiving System" as Receiver

== 1. Setup ==
loop per measure
    Extractor -> KR: $data-requirements
    KR -> KR: Process data requirements
    note right: 1. Include date-based filtering\n2. Map filters to search parameters\n3. Prune data elements based on measure usage (incl attr)\n4. Eliminate duplicates
    KR -> Extractor: Library.dataRequirement (0..*)
end
note right: Measure selection
Extractor -> Extractor: Analyze requirements
note right: 1. Collect value sets across data requirements
Extractor -> TS: GET ValueSet(s)
note right: Use CapabilityStatement\nDetermine applicable expansions
TS -> Extractor: ValueSet(s)

== 2. Attribution/Selection ==
loop per measure
    Extractor -> Extractor: Determine attribution
    note right: DaVinci Attribution use case
    loop per patient
        loop per selective data element
            Extractor -> DR: GET data element
            note right: Use fhirQueryPattern
            DR -> Extractor: Bundle
        end
        Extractor -> Extractor: Determine applicable population
        note right: If all bundles have data, patient is potentially a member of the IP
    end
    note right: Subset attributed patients by\ninitial population applicability
end
note right: Measure selection

== 3. Submission ==
loop per patient
    loop per measure
        loop per data element not marked selective
            Extractor -> DR: GET data element
            note right: Use fhirQueryPattern
            DR -> Extractor: Bundle
        end
        Extractor -> Receiver: $submit-data
        note right: Extractor constructs a bundle with all\n data retrieved from the repository\nReturn errors encountered
        Receiver -> Extractor: OperationOutcome
    end
end
note right: Consider submission period\nConsider bulk data

== 4. Evaluation (individual/group) ==
loop per measure
    Extractor -> Receiver: $evaluate-measure
    Receiver -> Extractor: MeasureReport
end
note right: Bulk data

== 5. Care Gaps ==
loop per measure
    Extractor -> Receiver: $care-gaps
    Receiver -> Extractor: Bundle (care gap document)
end
note right: Bulk data
