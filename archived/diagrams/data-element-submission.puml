title Data Element Submission Scenario
participant "Data Repository" as DR
participant "Submitting System" as Submitter
participant "Knowledge Repository" as KR
participant "Terminology Service" as TS
participant "Receiving System" as Receiver

== 1. Setup ==
loop per measure
    Submitter -> KR: $data-requirements
    KR -> KR: Process data requirements
    note right: 1. Include date-based filtering\n2. Map filters to search parameters\n3. Prune data elements based on measure usage (incl attr)\n4. Eliminate duplicates
    KR -> Submitter: Library.dataRequirement (0..*)
end
note right: Measure selection
Submitter -> Submitter: Analyze requirements
note right: 1. Collect value sets across data requirements
Submitter -> TS: GET ValueSet(s)
note right: Use CapabilityStatement\nDetermine applicable expansions
TS -> Submitter: ValueSet(s)

== 2. Attribution/Selection ==
loop per measure
    Submitter -> Submitter: Determine attribution
    note right: DaVinci Attribution use case
    loop per patient
        loop per selective data element
            Submitter -> DR: GET data element
            note right: Use fhirQueryPattern
            DR -> Submitter: Bundle
        end
        Submitter -> Submitter: Determine applicable population
        note right: If all bundles have data, patient is potentially a member of the IP
    end
    note right: Subset attributed patients by initial population applicability
end
note right: Measure selection

== 3. Submission ==
loop per patient
    loop per measure
        loop per non-selective data element
            Submitter -> DR: GET data element
            note right: Use fhirQueryPattern
            DR -> Submitter: Bundle
        end
        Submitter -> Receiver: $submit-data
        note right: Submitter constructs a bundle with all data retrieved from the repository\nReturn errors encountered
        Receiver -> Submitter: OperationOutcome
    end
end
note right: Consider submission period\nConsider bulk data

== 4. Evaluation (individual/group) ==
loop per measure
    Submitter -> Receiver: $evaluate-measure
    Receiver -> Submitter: MeasureReport
end
note right: Bulk data

== 5. Care Gaps ==
loop per measure
    Submitter -> Receiver: $care-gaps
    Receiver -> Submitter: Bundle (care gap document)
end
note right: Bulk data
