# Quality Measure IG STU3 Change Log

This log details the changes that have occurred to the Quality Measure IG since the STU3 Ballot Publication (v2.1.0).
These changes will be published as part of the STU3 release (v3.0.0)

## Terminology Services Change Summary

### Changes to the CQFMExecutableValueSet profile:

* Changed the warning extension from cqfm-usageWarning to valueset-warning (base extension)
* Changed the fixed value of the warning extension to discuss conformance only (moved guidance to the IG)
* Changed expansion contains elements to require a version unless the parameters element has a system-version for the system

### Changes to the CQFMQualityProgram profile:

* Removed cqfm-activeOnly and cqfm-expansionUri extensions in favor of the more general cqfm-expansionParameters extension

### Changes to the ValueSet/$expand operation:

* Clarified semantics of the manifest parameter
* Clarified semantics of the expansion parameter
* Changed includePreview parameter to includeDraft

### Changes to the Measure Terminology Service:

* Added Expansion Rules to describe expected expansion behavior in the presence of a manifest
* Recommended support for useContext search parameters
* Recommended support for reference search parameters

#### Changes to align with FHIR publishing

* Added support for the `terminology` model of a server's capability statement
* Added support for batch operations for $validate-code
* Required support for `activeOnly` and `displayLanguage` in $validate-code
* Required support for `activeOnly`, `displayLanguage`, `limitedExpansion`, and `default-to-latest-version` parameters in $expand
* Recommended support for `includeDesignation`, `designation`, and `paging` parameters in $expand

### Outstanding Questions

* Search by URL should return all versions with that URL, otherwise there is no way to get the list of versions for a given value set URL
* If searches return a SUBSETTED resource by default, should the server should allow the _summary=false parameter to request full resources?
* Given the `id` of a ValueSet is the OID, how can I retrieve specific versions of a ValueSet?
* How can I retrieve a list of available expansions for a given ValueSet URL?
* Can I use a GET to invoke $expand with both the url and valueSetVersion parameters? (Connectathon testing resulted in an error)

## Measure Representation Change Summary

### Changes to the CQFMMeasure profile:

* Required CQFMMeasure Library reference to be a CQFMLibrary
* Relaxed scoring, type, and improvementNotation cardinality

### Changes to the CQFMComputableMeasure profile:

* Changed cardinality of group to 0..*
* Changed the representation of effective data requirements on a measure to use a contained module definition library, rather than extensions in the measure
* Added fhirQueryPattern extension to communicate FHIR queries
* Added isSelective extension to dataRequirement
* Added valueFilter extension to support additional filtering in dataRequirement
* Added constraints to enforce scoring, populationBasis, and improvementNotation be specified at the root or all groups, but not both
* Added constraints to enforce population criteria in groups based on the group scoring extension
* Required Library to be a CQFMComputableLibrary and all expressions to be text/cql-expression or -identifier

### Added CQFMExecutableMeasure

* Required Library to be a CQFMExecutableLibrary and all expressions to be text/cql-identifier

### Changes to measure repository service:

* Removed the bundle-based packaging profiles in favor of artifact-based profiles to ensure artifact packaging can use paging when artifact packages contain a large number of components
* Added support for advertising CQL version support

### Changes to measure authoring:

* Allowed any number of models to be referenced, rather than requiring one and only one reference to QICore
* Recommended not disabling method invocation to allow fluent functions to be used
* Added support for mixed-basis ratio measure
* Added ability to associated stratifiers with specific populations
* Added the ability to specify scoringUnit for a measure
* Added composite scoring code
